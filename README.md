## ⚠️ Important: What This Analysis Covers

This analysis examines **procurement contracts awarded in 2025**, showing total contract values over their full life (which may span multiple years).

**This is NOT total government spending.** It excludes:
- Social security payments (Age Pension, NDIS, Centrelink)
- Medicare and health transfers
- Grants programs
- Transfers to states/territories
- Public service salaries
- Direct departmental appropriations

**Contract values** represent maximum amounts over the contract life, not annual expenditure. For comprehensive government spending, see the [Budget Papers](https://budget.gov.au) or [Parliamentary Budget Office](https://www.pbo.gov.au).

**Analysis verification**: All statistics are generated from [`analyze_federal_contracts.py`](analyze_federal_contracts.py) - run it yourself to verify the numbers.
